# BiLINGUAL

This is BiLINGUAL, the website to help you learn basic German vocabulary wrapped inside of a fun game! 

Although learning a new language is a great thing, it can oftentimes end up being a boring chore instead. Throughout the journey of learning a language, people spend most of their time trying to understand the grammar which often results in not having enough practice with the basic vocabulary needed to communicate in daily life.

BiLINGUAL was built to help with this endeavor. The users can learn German vocabulary by playing a simple but fun game.

## Product Decisions

### User Needs

As a person who...

- is learning a new language I want to master basic vocabulary quickly so that I can start interacting with native speakers.
- is encouraged by instant feedback on my actions I would like to quickly see what I’m doing wrong so that I stay motivated to practice.
- likes to track their own progress I’d like to compare my previous and current results so that I see how I improve over time.
- takes a language course where vocabulary is not covered extensively I want to expand my vocabulary so that I won’t be stressed in new situations.


### MVP
For the MVP it was important to have the basic concept of the game running. During the game round, users are offered a quiz-like question where they have to select the right image card according to the German word displayed at the top. The game is structured in such a way that in the future new languages and vocabulary categories can be added easily.

## Design Decisions

### Design Process
To make sure that the focus lies on the functionality, the design process of the game was first captured in low-fidelity mockups before adding visuals.

### Visual Design
The goal of a good visual design should be to support the structure of the UI so that the user can achieve their goals easily. Therefore, the visual design for this project was kept simple and clean with the aim of having more focus on important features.

#### Fonts
The font family [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter?query=inter) was chosen as the most suitable font for BiLINGUAL. With its simplicity, Inter is a great addition to the game’s UI as it doesn’t attract too much attention but is still able to be used to highlight key textual information.

#### Colors
As images are the key factor of the game, the color palette was kept simple to make sure the emphasis remains on images themselves. As a result, the rest of the UI doesn’t attract too much of the attention. Critical information, however, is highlighted with the vibrant primary color so that the user doesn’t miss any important feedback.

#### Accessibility
The color palette has sufficient contrast and the fonts are well readable which ensures the game is accessible even to visitors with impaired vision.
